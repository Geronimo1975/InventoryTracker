Project: Inventory Management System
Project Description:
Develop a simple inventory management system for a store. The system will:

Allow the user to add, remove, and update products.
Retrieve product information.
Calculate the total inventory value.
The implementation will include classes for Product and InventoryManager and use Python's unittest module for unit testing. Mocking will be used to simulate external dependencies.

File Descriptions:

inventory/product.py: Contains the Product class with attributes (e.g., name, price, quantity) and methods for updating product details and retrieving product information.
inventory/inventory_manager.py: Contains the InventoryManager class with methods for managing inventory operations (e.g., add/remove products, update quantities, calculate total value).
tests/test_inventory_manager.py: Contains unit tests for InventoryManager and Product classes.
main.py: Entry point to initialize the application, manage inventory, and calculate total value.
Implementation Steps:
Product Class (product.py):

Attributes: name, price, quantity.
Methods:
update_quantity: Update the quantity of a product.
get_product_info: Return a string representation of the product's information.
InventoryManager Class (inventory_manager.py):

Methods:
add_product: Add a new product to the inventory.
remove_product: Remove a product from the inventory.
update_quantity: Update the quantity of an existing product.
retrieve_product_info: Retrieve a product's details by its name.
get_total_inventory_value: Calculate the total worth of the inventory.
Main Program (main.py):

Create an instance of InventoryManager.
Add sample products.
Calculate and print total inventory value.
Unit Tests (test_inventory_manager.py):

Use the unittest module.
Test:
Product creation, addition, removal.
Quantity updates and total inventory value.
Mock external dependencies (e.g., logging).
Optional Features:

Categorize products.
Generate inventory reports.
Search functionality.
Mocking for Testing:

Mock external logging using a simulated service (add_product_with_logging).
Isolate testing by simulating interactions with Product and InventoryManager.
Best Practices and Additional Considerations:
Code Quality:

Use clear variable names and comments.
Write modular and reusable code.
Testing:

Cover all edge cases in unit tests.
Use mocking to simulate external dependencies.
Documentation:

Add docstrings to all classes and methods.
SCRUM Workflow:

Roles: Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team.
Backlog: Add, remove, update products; retrieve information; calculate total value.
Sprints: Break tasks into achievable goals and track progress using a Kanban board.
Expected Outputs:
Product addition, removal, and updates.
Inventory retrieval and total value calculations.
Unit test results showing all functionalities working as intended.
Languages and Tools:
Programming Language: Python
Testing Framework: unittest
Mocking Library: unittest.mock
Optional GUI: Tkinter (for user-friendly interaction)
